- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnthonyPrst. I'm happy to see you ! 
  I'm a engineer in wood construction and I think we can do more with the programmation in our job. 
  Python is the future !
- 👀 I’m interested in programmation and IA and I do a lot of ski ! (sorry, it's not a meeting app ?) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Eurocode or every subject in link with the construction or in the production unit.
- 📫 How to reach me ... the simplest is to send me an email at contact@ourea-structure.fr !
